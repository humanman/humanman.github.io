			Hello! And welcome to my page!
			</p>
			<p>
				I am very excited to embark on a career in web development, and to use pages like this to showcase my emerging skills in web building.
			</p>
			<p>
				I come from a film background with a heavy focus on cinematography and script writing.  I've travelled the world documenting artists and athletes; actors and musicians as a director of photography for music videos, short films, documentaries, and behind-the-scenes featurettes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile I have been writing various scripts for the big screen, the small screen, ad the computer screen.  Recently, I won a major writing contest hosted by VICE media and the Directors Bureau wherein I was chosen to have one of my short scripts produced.  I was flown to Mexico City to see my words come to life with SNL's Kyle Mooney as the lead.  It was an amazing experience I will forever cherish.
			</p>
			<p>
				My journey in film and writing has brought me to amazing places where I have met inspiring people, and now I begin a new chapter in my life. I have found a new medium to explore; within to create; from which to grow.
			</p>
			<p>
				The world of web development seems to grow almost exponentially each day, and I am drawn to the potential each burgeoning sector has to offer.
			</p>
			<p>
				From simple web games to augmented reality, so much can be gained from learning the basic tools to operate within technology, and I want to use my background in creative development to bring artistry to the work I will be doing in this exciting field.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope you check in again, as I improve my portfolio and evolve as a web developer.  See you soon!  <strong>PS: My Spirit Animal is the Ewok</strong>
